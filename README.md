## üß† Introduction

_Our project is a portable, non-invasive hemoglobin monitoring system designed to make affordable and accessible health tracking possible - especially in rural and resource-limited settings._

_it uses optical sensors and machine learning algorithms to estimate hemoglobin levels from light absorption data, eliminating the need for painful blood tests, providing users with real-time results on their smartphones._

_this device is built with low-cost hardware and aims to empower individuals, healthcare workers, and community clinics with tools to monnitor anemia and related conditions effectively._

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

_Anemia affects over 2 billion people globally, with India alone accounting for 57% of women aged 15-49 suffering from it (NFHS-5, 2019-21). Despite this, regular hemoglobin testing remains a challenge due to:_

_High cost and invasiveness of traditional methods (blood draws, lab tests)._

_Lack of access to diagnostic tools in rural and remote areas._

_No real-time, portable, or continuous monitoring solutions available._

_This diagnostic gap delays treatment and increases the risk of complications, especially for women, children, and the elderly in underprivileged communities._

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

_We‚Äôve developed a compact device that estimates hemoglobin levels non-invasively using light-based sensors and an AI-powered mobile application._

_üß™ How it works:
Sensors (AS7262 & MAX30102) capture spectroscopic and SpO‚ÇÇ data from the skin._

_ESP32 microcontroller processes and transmits data via Bluetooth._

_A mobile app built with Flutter receives the data and runs it through a machine learning model trained to predict hemoglobin concentration._

_Real-time results are displayed to the user, making it ideal for home use, community health workers, and small clinics._

_üéØ Key Features:
‚úÖ Non-invasive: No needles, no pain._

_‚úÖ Portable & lightweight: Easily carried anywhere._

_‚úÖ Affordable: Hardware costs are low._

_‚úÖ Real-time monitoring: Immediate results on mobile app._

_‚úÖ Environmental monitoring scope: Sensor support for light quality._

_‚úÖ Scalable: Potential integration with government health programs._
